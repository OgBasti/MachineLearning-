# Assignment 1 â€“ TelCom Solutions Churn Crisis

This project analyzes customer data from TelCom Solutions to predict customer churn using machine learning.

## Overview
- **Goal:** Predict which telecom customers are likely to leave (churn), and identify key factors influencing churn.
- **Data:** 2,999 customer records featuring account length, call usage, plans, interactions, and churn outcome.

## Main Features in Data
| Feature                  | Description                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| State                    | Customer location (state)                  |
| Account length           | Days person has been a customer            |
| Area code                | Customer area code                         |
| International plan       | Whether customer has this plan             |
| Voice mail plan          | Whether customer has this plan             |
| Number vmail messages    | Count of voice mails                       |
| Total day minutes/calls  | Usage stats for daytime                    |
| Total eve minutes/calls  | Usage stats for evening                    |
| Total night minutes/calls| Usage stats for night                      |
| Total intl minutes/calls | Usage stats for international              |
| Customer service calls   | Number of calls to customer service        |
| Churn                    | Target variable (True = left, False = kept)|

## Workflow
